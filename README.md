# Project Title

oldPeopleRecords

## Summary

1. Creating DB that stores memories of a human - in a text form, but indexed by years, places, another people. Like a photo album, but info album
2. Making of social network for old people, based on their memories to maintain their mental health.


## Background

For some people the last years of their life can be not so happy time. Sometimes they are alone, sometimes not, but their relatives can not spend a lot of time with them by different reasons. When these relatives become older themselves, they may feel sorry about it. Of course, there always is photos and videos, but most of them are made special, like photos for instagram.
People like to talk with another people. Now we have a voice assistances, like Siri, but they are more for business purposes or uses like voice to text converters.
The idea is to make a voice assistance for elder people, like a virtual relative for communications. Data provided from old human is stored in a database and is indexed if possible by years, people names and so on. It could also include voice samples or even data for video simulation. The idea is that you can "talk" with your grandma after her death. Sound creapy and reminds Saint Junipero episode from Black Mirror, but the idea is to create database that can be useful. 
On another side we have a point, that old people can remember people from old years. What if this other old human remebers the same? They could be connected for communication. That could make them more happy.


## How is it used?

1. "Records" of the people at the last years of their life
2. Maintaing mental health of elder people

## Data sources and AI methods
Small devices, voice accistances


## Challenges
The biggest challenge I think is the ethical problems, privacy and security. Main point is that old human can not define privacy settings (this could be public, this is private), then it should be done by network itself.

## What next?
Huh, for me that is final point, because I'm learning Python for now because it's now a boring time in my life, and it's clear for me that I can not even approach to this idea.
